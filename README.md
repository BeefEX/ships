# Ships
## Overview
This is an multiplayer game I created during Septeber 2017 as an collage project. It took about two weeks of work although not full time. It's UI is inside an terminal window, both CMD and Powershell work just fine, and is controlled using keyboard.

> This game was only designed to run under Windows, it may run on Linux if compiled using Mono but I won't be doing that any time soon.

## Project structure
The main solution contains 4 projects, 2 of them being executables and the other 2 libraries.

## Documentation
There is no documentation as of right now.

## Building
You can either build the whole solution at once or build only the project you need. This README contains instruction for building the whole solution~~, for instruction on separate projects please see their own README files~~.

### Building using an IDE

#### VS (2017)
Open the `Ships.sln` file using VS either by double clicking it in **Windows Explorer** or using the **Open** button in VS. Than press F5 to build the solution, all executable files should than be found in `bin` or `bin/dist` assuming there were no errors during the build.

#### Rider
Open the `Ships.sln` file using Rider either by double clicking it in **Windows Explorer** or using the **File>Open>Solution or Project** button in Rider.
